          <h2>Solid waste Management in Delhi NCR</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            <strong>Solid Waste Management (SWM) </strong>

            is one of the most expensive municipal services that a local body
            has to provide as its obligatory municipal function and absorbs
            about 1% of GNP in the urban areas. About three to six persons per
            1000 population are required to cater to this important civic
            amenity, which is about 1% to 2% of the total National Work Force.
            It is, therefore, imperative to optimize this huge civic expenditure
            and evolve an indigenous low cost technology which is technically
            sound, financially viable, aesthetically beautiful and socially
            acceptable to public. Regional Plan-2001 proposed that solid waste
            disposal and management should be planned for a minimum period of 20
            years and at least controlled tipping should be adopted in the
            disposal of the solid waste. Areas should be identified in all the
            towns for sanitary landfill and, all the towns above one lakh
            population should have arrangements to properly manage the waste
            disposal. In the review of Regional Plan-2001 it was observed that
            large quantities of solid waste (garbage) were generated daily, out
            of which very little was collected. NCT-Delhi, however had
            comparatively better collection (70% of the waste) than rest of NCR
            towns. Most landfill sites are brimming to the full and vacant sites
            for landfill are not available in Delhi. No specific sites have been
            identified in any Sub regions for disposal of solid wastes and
            landfill. .
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Existing Situation and Issues</strong><br> Studies have revealed that none of the
            towns in the region are disposing off solid waste in environmental
            friendly manner. The landfill sites are not lined to protect the
            ground water from leachate percolating into it. No other disposal
            system has been adopted by the local bodies. The status of
            availability of solid waste management facilities in some of the
            towns of NCR in the year 2000 is at Annexure 9/III in the RP 2021
            document. As per estimates, at present 13,499 MT/day of garbage was
            being generated in the year 2001 in the region, of which about 1,540
            MT/day was being generated from Haryana Sub-region, 201 MT/day was
            being generated from Rajasthan Sub-region and 2,270 MT/day was being
            generated from U.P. Sub-region and remaining from the NCT-Delhi
            Sub-region. Total garbage generation in the region is likely to be
            about 27,236 MT/day by the year 2021 and handling of this kind of
            waste will need special efforts and funds. Since land is a resource,
            the disposal methodologies for solid waste cannot remain only
            sanitary landfill. We have to examine other environmental friendly
            and financially viable options also.<br><br><strong>Some of the major issues in
				this sector include</strong><br>• Lack of Knowledge of the Local Bodies.<br>•
            Non-availability of suitable Land for Solid Waste Disposal in
            Environmental Friendly Manner.<br>• Lack of Public Awareness.<br>•
            Non-Availability of Funds<br>• Piecemeal Approach for Handling of Solid
            Waste<br><br><strong>Policies and Proposals</strong><br>In order to improve the overall
            situation in the National Capital Region for the harmonized and
            balanced development for the perspective 2021, following policies
            and strategies are proposed. <br><br><strong>Preparation of Detailed Solid Waste
				Management Plan</strong><br>All the towns in NCR should prepare Solid Waste
            Management Plan in order to handle the waste being generated in
            their respective towns on the basis of guidelines provided by the
            CPHEEO Manual for the solid waste management.<br><br><strong>Norms and Standards
				Norms and standards</strong><br>provided in the CPHEEO Manual for solid waste
            management which provides guidelines for collection, transfer,
            transport and disposal of solid waste in environmental friendly
            manner should be followed. <br><br><strong>Identification of Land for
				Treatment/Disposal of Waste</strong><br>While preparing the Master/Development
            Plan for various towns/cities, Town Planning Department of
            respective Sub-regions should earmark the land for
            treatment/disposal of solid waste. The acquisition of these sites,
            by the development authorities and municipalities, should form a
            compulsory element of the development programme and properly
            budgeted for in their Plan documents. Sanitary landfill sites should
            be designed and engineered properly to collect and treat leachate
            and biogas should be collected and utilized in a planned manner.
            Constituents States of NCR should also earmark land for solid waste
            disposal by sanitary landfill and other means appropriately. <br><br><strong>Waste
				Minimization-Recycling/Recovery of Resources</strong><br>In view of the limited
            availability of land for use as landfill sites, there is an urgent
            need to find other mechanical means of minimizing waste requiring
            disposal. In fact, RP 2021 suggests that zero waste output should be
            aimed. <br><br><strong>Public Awareness and Training</strong><br>Public awareness need to be
            created through mass media including T.V. and newspapers regarding
            the harmful affects of littering around and how the places can be
            kept clean. The informal training along with broad-based formal
            awareness through schools educational curriculum is also
            recommended. NGO's and Resident Welfare Association (RWA) should be
            actively involved in the public awareness campaign. <br><br><strong>Institutional
				Improvements</strong><br>Institutional capacity building measures are required
            to be taken in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
            solid waste management at each stage such as waste collection,
            transfer/transportation, treatment and disposal. There is a need to
            associate NGOs/private sector also in this regard. The combination
            of private sector and public sector in proportionate ratios will be
            the right option. In the rural areas, there is no mechanism for
            collection and disposal of solid waste. This should be developed by
            associating local Panchayats.<br><br><strong>Other Recommendations </strong><br> Other suggested
            measures, which are required to be taken, are as follows: <br>• Adoption
            of closed bins and covered transportation vehicles.<br>• Modification
            of building bye-laws to ensure provisions of refuse storage.<br>• Safe
            and separate storage as well as doorstep collection of biomedical
            waste, hotel and yard waste etc. on full cost recovery basis.<br>•
            Community participation<br>(Rules and regulations imposed pertaining to
            different kinds of waste and its management)

              <h3>Article from TOI detailing that no new landfills are to be made hereafter according to the Draft Master plan for Delhi 2024
              </h3>
              <p>
                The draft MPD41 wants no new landfill sites to be created and 'minimum waste localities' to be developed. With the aim of disposing of waste in a decentralised manner, the new plan is to repurpose the existing waste management infrastructure and treat the bulk of municipal waste locally, as close to the generation site as possible.
MPD41 also encourages setting up of large composting farms in green development areas (GDA) to be created on the city’s periphery and using large parks for composting or biomethanation of wet waste at the community level.
Delhi currently generates 12,350 tonnes of solid waste daily and this is expected to rise to 18,915 tonnes by 2041. Currently, of the total waste generated, only 85% is collected by the municipal corporations and much of it — 55% — ends up in the three overexploited landfills in Okhla, Ghazipur and Bhalswa.
The draft pushes for the creation of minimum waste localities, where all wet waste is treated locally while the dry waste is sent to recycling centres and material recovery centres to be set up to replace large dhalaos. All new development under the land pooling scheme, regeneration schemes or GDA have to be minimum waste localities.
The local bodies can now utilise portions of large parks for composting and bio-methanation of wet waste at community level. The plan is for a 200 sq metre area for every 10,000 population and material recovery facility of 200 tonnes per day for every five lakh population plus a large, automated recovery facility spread over 10,000-20,000 sq m at the city level. The waste management infra is to be repurposed and the existing dhalaos will be converted to material recovery facilities for waste segregation and recycling.
Waste segregation, decentralised treatment and informal sector participation of waste pickers have already been mandated in the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016m but their implementation has been an uphill task. The oversaturated landfills have been the most visible sign of this failure. MPD41 clearly states that the existing landfills will be incrementally reclaimed as green/recreational areas and no new landfills will be created, except those meant for dumping of inert solids. The bio-mining and reclamation project is already under way at the landfills as per the National Green Tribunal’s suo-motu order in cognisance of a TOI report.
The draft MPD41 proposes the creation of large composting farms in the notified GDAs and the adoption of incentives/ disincentives recommended by the National Resource Efficiency Policy, 2019, to minimise the environmental impact of municipal waste.

                <h3>Article on India’s challenges in waste management
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Waste management rules in India are based on the principles of "sustainable development","precaution" and "polluter pays". These principles mandate municipalities and commercial establishments to act in an environmentally accountable and responsible manner—restoring balance, if their actions disrupt it. The increase in waste generation as a by-product of economic development has led to various subordinate legislations for regulating the manner of disposal and dealing with generated waste are made under the umbrella law of Environment Protection Act, 1986 (EPA). Specific forms of waste are the subject matter of separate rules and require separate compliances, mostly in the nature of authorisations, maintenance of records and adequate disposal mechanisms.
With rapid urbanisation, the country is facing massive waste management challenge. Over 377 million urban people live in 7,935 towns and cities and generate 62 million tonnes of municipal solid waste per annum. Only 43 million tonnes (MT) of the waste is collected, 11.9 MT is treated and 31 MT is dumped in landfill sites. Solid Waste Management (SWM) is one among the basic essential services provided by municipal authorities in the country to keep urban centres clean. However, almost all municipal authorities deposit solid waste at a dumpyard within or outside the city haphazardly. Experts believe that India is following a flawed system of waste disposal and management.
The key to efficient waste management is to ensure proper segregation of waste at source and to ensure that the waste goes through different streams of recycling and resource recovery. Then reduced final residue is then deposited scientifically in sanitary landfills. Sanitary landfills are the ultimate means of disposal for unutilised municipal solid waste from waste processing facilities and other types of inorganic waste that cannot be reused or recycled. Major limitation of this method is the costly transportation of MSW to far away landfill sites.
A report by IIT Kanpur (2006) found the potential of recovering at least 15 per cent or 15,000 MT of waste generated every day in the country. This, the report said, could also provide employment opportunities to about 500,000 rag-pickers. The report added that despite immense potential in big cities in this area, participation from non-profits or community is limited.
In some urban centres, people working in the informal sector collect solid waste for each doorstep to get a collection fee and derive additional income from sale of recyclables. The informal recycling industry plays a major role in waste management. It also ensures that less waste reaches landfills.
00:0201:24
Iswar Ahluwalia, in an article, points out that more than three-fourth of solid waste management budget is allotted to collection and transportation, leaving leaves very little for processing or resource recovery and disposal.
There has been technological advancement for processing, treatment and disposal of solid waste. Energy-from-waste is a crucial element of SWM because it reduces the volume of waste from disposal also helps in converting the waste into renewable energy and organic manure. Ideally, it falls in the flow chart after segregation, collection, recycling and before getting to the land fill. But many waste to energy plants in India are not operating to their full potential.
Installation of waste-to-compost and bio-methanation plants would reduce the load of landfill sites. The biodegradable component of India’s solid waste is currently estimated at a little over 50 per cent. Bio-methanation is a solution for processing biodegradable waste which is also remains underexploited. It is believed that if we segregate biodegradable waste from the rest, it could reduce the challenges by half. E-waste components contain toxic materials and are non-biodegradable which present both occupational and environmental health threats including toxic smoke from recycling processes and leaching from e-waste in landfill into local water tables.
The concept of common waste treatment facility (ENVIS Newsletter, December 2010) is being widely promoted and accepted as it uses waste as a resource by either using it as a co-fuel or co-raw material in manufacturing processes. This has led to rise of Public Private Partnership (PPP) models in waste management which has open doors for doing business in waste management.
Bio-medical waste (management and handling) rules, 1998 prescribe that there should be a Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility (CBWTF) at every 150 kms in the country. CBWTFs have been set up and are functioning in cities and towns. However, establishment of functional CBWTF throughout the country must be ensured. Integrated common hazardous waste management facilities combine secured landfill facility, solidification/stabilisation and incineration to treat hazardous wastes generated by various industrial units. They contribute about 97.8 per cent of total landfill waste and 88 per cent of total incinerable hazardous waste generated in the country, as per an environment ministry report.

                Around 100 cities are set to be developed as smart cities. Civic bodies have to redraw long term vision in solid waste management and rework their strategies as per changing lifestyles. They should reinvent garbage management in cities so that we can process waste and not landfill it (with adequate provisioning in processing and recycling).To do this, households and institutions must segregate their waste at source so that it could be managed as a resource. The Centre aims to do away with landfill sites in 20 major cities. There is no spare land for dumping garbage, the existing ones are in a critical state. It is reported that almost 80 per cent of the waste at Delhi landfill sites could be recycled provided civic bodies start allowing ragpickers to segregate waste at source and recycle it. Compost pits should be constructed in every locality to process organic waste. Community participation has a direct bearing on efficient waste management. Recovery of e-waste is abysmally low, we need to encourage recycling of e-waste on a very large scale level so that problem of e-waste disposal is contained.

            <strong>1. Food waste </strong>
            <br>
            Most of the food waste in the campus can be categorised as two types:
            <br>

•	Plate waste: Food that is thrown by the students after the meals
<br>
•	Cooking waste: Leftover food after the food service
<br>
Collection of waste is measured on the stand to be calculated how to be recycled. This helps to tell how much food is wasted and effective ways to segregate it to recycle it. Ways the waste can be segregated: The campus mostly sends plate waste to be used as manure while the cooking waste is sent to pigries and converted as animal food. The organic waste converter plant installed on campus produces manure from food waste from all the cafeterias in the university. Approximately 200+ kg of manure is produced in a year

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. Solid waste</strong><br> 
            Solid waste can be separated into two main categories: <br>
•	Waste from the Towers, Academic blocks and Hostels <br>
•	Waste from other sources <br>
The hostel dustbins are emptied on a daily basis in the morning while those in the academic blocks are emptied twice a day. The dustbins are emptied into a large common dustbin outside the blocks and hostels from where they are carried to the main area of separation. In the main area, they are segregated to recyclable and non-recyclable waste. The waste is then sold off to different vendors based on what waste it is and how it can be recycled. A total of 10441+ Kg of boxes have been recycled into stationery products through the University's Service provide.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3. Wet waste</strong><br> 
            There are two Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) in the campus: <br>
•	STP 500kld ; This is a modular plant ( 200+200+100) which treats contaminated/used water from the Academic and Hostel Blocks. <br>
•	STP 150kld ; This is a modular plant (50+100) which treats contaminated/used water from campus housing. <br>
The recycled water is used for horticulture and for the SNU lake, a part of Bil Akbarpur wetlands which gets fresh water through the drains installed in the various gardens on campus along with the treated water.

The University is a Zero Discharge Campus - which means that our campus doesn’t produce any waste as all the waste generated is recycled.
