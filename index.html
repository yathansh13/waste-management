          <p>
            <strong>The Process of</strong> Waste management (or waste disposal)
            includes the actions required to manage waste from its inception to
            its final disposal. This includes the collection, transport,
            treatment and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and
            regulation of the waste management process and waste-related laws,
            technologies, economic mechanisms.

          <h2>Solid waste Management in Delhi NCR</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            <strong>Solid Waste Management (SWM) </strong>

            is one of the most expensive municipal services that a local body
            has to provide as its obligatory municipal function and absorbs
            about 1% of GNP in the urban areas. About three to six persons per
            1000 population are required to cater to this important civic
            amenity, which is about 1% to 2% of the total National Work Force.
            It is, therefore, imperative to optimize this huge civic expenditure
            and evolve an indigenous low cost technology which is technically
            sound, financially viable, aesthetically beautiful and socially
            acceptable to public. Regional Plan-2001 proposed that solid waste
            disposal and management should be planned for a minimum period of 20
            years and at least controlled tipping should be adopted in the
            disposal of the solid waste. Areas should be identified in all the
            towns for sanitary landfill and, all the towns above one lakh
            population should have arrangements to properly manage the waste
            disposal. In the review of Regional Plan-2001 it was observed that
            large quantities of solid waste (garbage) were generated daily, out
            of which very little was collected. NCT-Delhi, however had
            comparatively better collection (70% of the waste) than rest of NCR
            towns. Most landfill sites are brimming to the full and vacant sites
            for landfill are not available in Delhi. No specific sites have been
            identified in any Sub regions for disposal of solid wastes and
            landfill. .
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Existing Situation and Issues</strong><br> Studies have revealed that none of the
            towns in the region are disposing off solid waste in environmental
            friendly manner. The landfill sites are not lined to protect the
            ground water from leachate percolating into it. No other disposal
            system has been adopted by the local bodies. The status of
            availability of solid waste management facilities in some of the
            towns of NCR in the year 2000 is at Annexure 9/III in the RP 2021
            document. As per estimates, at present 13,499 MT/day of garbage was
            being generated in the year 2001 in the region, of which about 1,540
            MT/day was being generated from Haryana Sub-region, 201 MT/day was
            being generated from Rajasthan Sub-region and 2,270 MT/day was being
            generated from U.P. Sub-region and remaining from the NCT-Delhi
            Sub-region. Total garbage generation in the region is likely to be
            about 27,236 MT/day by the year 2021 and handling of this kind of
            waste will need special efforts and funds. Since land is a resource,
            the disposal methodologies for solid waste cannot remain only
            sanitary landfill. We have to examine other environmental friendly
            and financially viable options also.<br><br><strong>Some of the major issues in
				this sector include</strong><br>• Lack of Knowledge of the Local Bodies.<br>•
            Non-availability of suitable Land for Solid Waste Disposal in
            Environmental Friendly Manner.<br>• Lack of Public Awareness.<br>•
            Non-Availability of Funds<br>• Piecemeal Approach for Handling of Solid
            Waste<br><br><strong>Policies and Proposals</strong><br>In order to improve the overall
            situation in the National Capital Region for the harmonized and
            balanced development for the perspective 2021, following policies
            and strategies are proposed. <br><br><strong>Preparation of Detailed Solid Waste
				Management Plan</strong><br>All the towns in NCR should prepare Solid Waste
            Management Plan in order to handle the waste being generated in
            their respective towns on the basis of guidelines provided by the
            CPHEEO Manual for the solid waste management.<br><br><strong>Norms and Standards
				Norms and standards</strong><br>provided in the CPHEEO Manual for solid waste
            management which provides guidelines for collection, transfer,
            transport and disposal of solid waste in environmental friendly
            manner should be followed. <br><br><strong>Identification of Land for
				Treatment/Disposal of Waste</strong><br>While preparing the Master/Development
            Plan for various towns/cities, Town Planning Department of
            respective Sub-regions should earmark the land for
            treatment/disposal of solid waste. The acquisition of these sites,
            by the development authorities and municipalities, should form a
            compulsory element of the development programme and properly
            budgeted for in their Plan documents. Sanitary landfill sites should
            be designed and engineered properly to collect and treat leachate
            and biogas should be collected and utilized in a planned manner.
            Constituents States of NCR should also earmark land for solid waste
            disposal by sanitary landfill and other means appropriately. <br><br><strong>Waste
				Minimization-Recycling/Recovery of Resources</strong><br>In view of the limited
            availability of land for use as landfill sites, there is an urgent
            need to find other mechanical means of minimizing waste requiring
            disposal. In fact, RP 2021 suggests that zero waste output should be
            aimed. <br><br><strong>Public Awareness and Training</strong><br>Public awareness need to be
            created through mass media including T.V. and newspapers regarding
            the harmful affects of littering around and how the places can be
            kept clean. The informal training along with broad-based formal
            awareness through schools educational curriculum is also
            recommended. NGO's and Resident Welfare Association (RWA) should be
            actively involved in the public awareness campaign. <br><br><strong>Institutional
				Improvements</strong><br>Institutional capacity building measures are required
            to be taken in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
            solid waste management at each stage such as waste collection,
            transfer/transportation, treatment and disposal. There is a need to
            associate NGOs/private sector also in this regard. The combination
            of private sector and public sector in proportionate ratios will be
            the right option. In the rural areas, there is no mechanism for
            collection and disposal of solid waste. This should be developed by
            associating local Panchayats.<br><br><strong>Other Recommendations </strong><br> Other suggested
            measures, which are required to be taken, are as follows: <br>• Adoption
            of closed bins and covered transportation vehicles.<br>• Modification
            of building bye-laws to ensure provisions of refuse storage.<br>• Safe
            and separate storage as well as doorstep collection of biomedical
            waste, hotel and yard waste etc. on full cost recovery basis.<br>•
            Community participation<br>(Rules and regulations imposed pertaining to
            different kinds of waste and its management)<br><br><strong>Plastic Carry Bags:</strong><br>
            Delhi Govt. had imposed ban on manufacture, sale, storage, usage,
            import and transport of all kinds of plastic carry bags in NCT of
            Delhi vide Notification dated 23.10.2012. This notification was
            challenged in the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi by All India Plastic
            Industries Association (WPC 7012/2012). Hon’ble NGT as per its order
            dated in 2017 directed that there shall be complete prohibition on
            use of plastic carry bags, made of plastic less than 50 microns and
            are non-compostable in entire NCT Delhi, for any purpose whatsoever.
            The Hon’ble Green Court also directed the NCT Delhi, Delhi Pollution
            Control Committee and all public authorities /local bodies to ensure
            that sale, storage and use of such plastic at the shops or otherwise
            is not permitted. If any person is found in possession or uses such
            plastic, shall be liable to pay Environmental compensation of Rs.
            5000/- per default.
